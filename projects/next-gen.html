    <h1>Next Gen Websites Platform</h1>

    <p>By Q1 of 2014, research have shown that mobile traffic accounts for nearly two-thirds of visitors to auto dealership websites on CDK’s platform. However, the decade-old platform was only capable of building and supporting fix-width sites. A separate mobile solution was released in 2009 but it required additional configuration and only displays a subset of information available on the main site.</p>
    <p>The Next Gen platform was my team’s attempt at modernizing CDK’s website platform. This project was a followup to Modularizing Auto Dealership Content project I have previously completed. For this project, I collaborated with a group of designers , a lead architect, a multitude of lead developers, along with the product owner. I was involved from ideation to launch and was responsible for sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and presenting concepts/solutions to stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Aside from needing to be able to generate websites that meet the needs of modern car shoppers, the business requires new platform to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decrease the cost of creating/migrating and maintaining websites.</li>
        <li>Be capable of serving personalized shopping experiences.</li>
        <li>Be able to integrate legacy data sources.</li>
        <li>Provide design differentiation and customization.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From the user’s perspective, the new platform has to satisfy the following use cases:</p>

    <h2>Risk &amp; Opportunity</h2>
    <p>
        My team and I engaged internal groups that make up the majority of users of the old platform and together we identified several risks and opportunities:
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        Risk
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strong aversion to give the impression that we are taking control away from dealers.</li>
        <li>Dependency on legacy systems limit the possibility of innovation on the new product, resulting in the need to support both for a period of time instead of making a clean break.</li>
        <li>How to effectively migrate 6,000 dealers on our old platform into the new one.</li>
        <li>User training and continuing education. Gathering support and involvement in changing decade-old processes and teams are reluctant to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="bold">Opportunity</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplify the website editing experience. Make editing website a simple task so dealers can go back to what they do best — sell cars. </li>
        <li>In order to reduce the complexity of updating websites and given that there appears to be a pattern of similarity in content found on dealership websites, could we offer pre-bundled modular customizable content that dealers can pick and choose from to make you their website?</li>
        <li>Based on previous content analysis I have done, we know that dealership website content tend to fall into identifiable categories. This means we can specifically target and manipulate them. CDK already has a personalization product offering and this would provide a way to integrate this into websites.</li>
        <li>Separating content from presentation enables us to update the look and feel of websites more quickly by swapping style files. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sketches</h2>

    <p class="bold">This concept was inspired by the 5-paragraph essay we had to write in school. Beginning with a “thesis” (the topic of the page), we could suggest content based on entity relationships that’s been identified previously. </p>

    <p class="bold">Migration</p>
    <p>As a reach goal for the project, the Lead Architect and I ideated on a self-migration tool.</p>

    <h2>Pitches</h2>
    <p>Because of the scale of the overhaul, the team needed to get buy-in from various groups within CDK. I was responsible for presenting user workflows at the meeting.</p>

    <h2>Retrospective</h2>
    <p>Although the Next Gen platform successfully launched in 2016 and have been adopted by around 6000 dealerships across the US, Australia and Canada, there are areas in the design process that I believe we could have improved upon. </p>
    <p>I learned that in order to design and build products well, it is imperative to gather and consult with every group that will be impacted by it. It is arrogant for a single design/development group to define the “right solution” independent of others and expect it to work well without considering the rest of the environment and players. As a junior designer new to the group, I overly relied on my seniors to make sure that user research included in the process which unfortunately didn't happen as I expected. I learned that there are situations where you need to speak up for what you believe it the right thing and call things out.</p>

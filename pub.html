            <h1>Responsive Digital Publication</h1>
            <p>Prior to the release of Windows 8, Cypress Consulting was invited by Microsoft to explore the potential of applying adaptive design techniques onto digital publications. </p>

        <h2>Challange</h2>
        <p>eReaders have become increasingly common as digital publications gain popularity in recent years. Most were first available as hardware reader then as apps for mobile/desktop devices. Recently, some have become available as multi-platform HTML5 web apps. Most digital publications, however, remain fairly similar to their print counterparts. Careful application modern web technologies may be what is needed to break away from the archaic constraints of print publications.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>For this project, I performed a competitive analysis to see the lay of the land. Then I created personas and storyboarded two aspirational reading experiences. Finally, I deconstructed said experiences into atomic pieces that can be recombined into new experiences.</p>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

        <span class="bold">Kindle Reader</span>
        <p>The Kindle was available first available as a hardware reader, then as apps for various mobile devices and the desktop, and most recently as multi-platform HTML5 reader. Features available depends on the platform. Currently, the HTML5 reader pales in comparison to the hardware reader and apps. </p>

        <span class="bold">Digital Magazines</span>
        <p>At their worst, magazines of the iPad appear to be direct static transplant of their print counterparts. At their best, they are chock-full with interactive elements but do not fully utilize the power of the digital platform. </p>

        <span class="bold">HTML5 Showcase</span>
        <p>Although not yet fully supported by all browser, available showcases demonstrate many interactive components that can be utilized to create a more dynamic reading experience. The HTML5 reading experience could incorporate interactive elements common to current digital publications along with others such as geolocation, drag-and-drop, augmented-reality, animation, etc. </p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>The following are two aspirational reading scenarios. The first explores how a digital guide book could accompany a publication before, during, and after a trip to the museum. The second explores how another publication could benefit a student as he completes his coursework.</p>

        <h3>Architecture-Greek Nina</h3>
        <p>Nina is a freshman at the University of Washington who have just completed a coursework on the history of architecture. She is interested in Byzantine architecture and have decided to spend her summer vacation in Istambul to experience the buildings in real life. In preparation for her trip, Nina scoured her local library for materials related to the Byzantine era. Although there are many books on the subject, Nina found them to be “flat” and “dated.”</p>
        <p>While searching online for information about the Hagia Sophia, Nina discovered an interactive book that promises a guided before-, during-, and after-visit experience to the museum.</p>

        <span class="bold">Before the trip, Nina learns the ins and outs of Hagia Sophia and takes notes of any points-of-interests that she would like to see at the museum.</span>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/pub/pub_nina1.jpg" />
        </figure>

        <span class="bold">During the trip, Nina easily locates her points-of-interest using her phone’s geolocation capabilities. She also takes photos and records her thoughts and impressions of the museum.</span>

        </figure>

        <span class="bold">After the trip, Nina takes her collection of responses and images she made while at the Hagia Sophia and adds them to the text.</span>

        </figure>

        <h3>Literature-Student Johann</h3>
        <p>Johann is a university student majoring in English. As part of his coursework, he is required to read and analyze various forms of literature. Instead of carrying physical copies, Johan decided to explore the idea of keeping a digital collection of works.</p>
        <p>Johann’s digital collection allows him to keep all his course materials in a centralized location accessible via all his internet-enabled devices. It not only provides a superior reading experience, it has additional utilities that helps Johann complete his coursework.</p>

        <span class="bold">The digital collection allows Johann to keep all his course materials in a centralized location acessible via phone, tablet, and desktop.</span>

        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Although this project did not end up being developed into a product, it was a personally very enjoyable one as it allowed me to use skills I do not get to often use. Being an early adopter of the Kindle and an avid reader, it was an exciting project for me to take as it allowed me to paint a picture of my ideal reading experience.</p>

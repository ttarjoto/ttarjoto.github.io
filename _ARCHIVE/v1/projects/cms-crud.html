    <h1>Next Gen CMS CRUD Redesign</h1>

    <p>Historically, only Product, Engineering, and Services organizations are involved in determining which projects make it onto the product roadmap. Designers are often engaged only when it comes time to act upon a project. As lead UX designer, I felt it was very important to build trust between cross-functional teams and to advocate for my organization. </p>

    <p>This project was the first of a series modeled after Google Venture’s Design Sprint completed over 6+ months as part of a collaborative effort to implement a more rigorous user-centered design and testing process for the Websites team at CDK. I was responsible for arranging and facilitating the sprint. My tasks include distilling and articulating the problem, and keeping discussion on track, along with prototyping, testing and supporting the long tail. I was also the subject matter expert for Next Gen. Core participants were myself, two designers, a researcher, the product owner, and the lead developer.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>It had been almost 2 years since the launch of the Next Gen websites platform. Over that time, my team and I have collected both internal and external users feedbacks, many of which centered around the CRUD experience in the CMS. For this project, we chose to concentrate on the following issues:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Content Library landing page/experience is unfriendly and overwhelming for light and moderate users.</li>
        <li>Content types are confusing. The meaning and purpose is unclear.</li>
        <li>Content library structure and system is not intuitive/discoverable: content reuse model does not match some user groups' expectation and process.</li>
        <li>There is no obvious way to create a new record.</li>
        <li>List of content types on left panel of View All Records is overwhelming and forces users to filter to a content type before they need to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I spent some time prior to the start of the project catching other designers and researched the ins and outs of the Next Gen Platform. Once this is done, we spent a week exploring the problem and sketching solutions. The next week was spent prototyping and testing with users, followed by another week of writing functional specifications.</p>

    <h3> Ideation &amp; sketching</h3>
    <p>Overall, the team went through 3 rounds of ideation and refinements. By the end of the 3rd round, there were two likely solutions. The group then went through an exercise to vet every design decisions against a pain-point. After which we were able to iterate to create a single solution to be tested. </p>

    <h3>Rapid prototyping and testing</h3>
    <p>Due to time constraints and participants access, we chose to test using paper prototypes with internal users. I quickly refined the sketches using Sketch and handed them to the researcher for testing.</p>

            Using paper prototypes got us better feedback by eliminating technical distractions. It is easy and cheap and allows us to run multiple quick tests before going into development.

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>By the end of this project, we successfully demonstrated to the business the benefit of a design process. Developers are more open to feedback and would initiate contract with the design group for input.  Internal user groups now don’t hesitate to volunteer their time when needed. </p>
    <p>Although these projects did not address all the underlying issues, it did go a long way to building trust and better rapport between all groups involved, paving the way for future improvements.</p>

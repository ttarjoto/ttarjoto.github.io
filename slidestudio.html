            <h1>Slide Studio</h1>
            <p>Historically, only Product, Engineering, and Services organizations are involved in determining which projects make it onto the product roadmap. Designers are often engaged only when it comes time to act upon a project. As lead UX designer, I felt it was very important to build trust between cross-functional teams and to advocate for my organization.</p>

            <p>This project was one of a series modeled after GV’s Design Sprint completed over 6+ months as part of a collaborative effort to implement a more rigorous user-centered design and testing process for the Websites team at CDK.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The hero slide rotator is considered prime real estate on dealership websites as it sits immediately below the header and is the first thing consumers see upon landing on the site. The hero is also an area of contention between dealers and OEMs as both want their messages to appear first/earlier in rotation.</p>
        <p>The existing slide creation and management workflows was unintentionally convoluted for both internal and external users. Among others, the purpose of some actions/inputs were unclear and the available features were seen regression from the previous platform. The goal of this project is to analyze the workflow and design a solution to improve it.</p>

        <h2>Users</h2>
        <p>I spent time prior to the start of the sprint interviewing users and SMEs to pinpoint exactly where the workflow breaks down down. Then I made the following user journey to illustrate and convey the problem to my team.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I was both facilitator and and designer for this sprint as we were down one team member. My tasks include distilling and articulating the problem, and keeping discussion on track, along with sketching, prototyping, testing and supporting the long tail. Core participants were myself, another designers, a researcher, the product owner, and the lead developer.</p>

        <h2>Rapid Prototyping &amp; Testing</h2>
        <p>Due to time constraints and participants access, we chose to test using paper prototypes with internal users.</p>

            <figcaption>Using paper prototypes got us better feedback by eliminating technical distractions. It is easy and cheap and allows us to run multiple quick tests before going into development.</figcaption>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Slide Studio launched in Mar 2018 and have since resulted in 65% reduction of the time it takes to manage hero slides. It is one of the most successful and well-liked Next Gen tools and its launch was noted to be particularly “smooth”. Slide Studio is being continually updated, with the latest iteration slated to be launched sometime in 2019.</p>
